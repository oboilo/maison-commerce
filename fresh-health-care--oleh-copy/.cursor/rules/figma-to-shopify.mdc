## Responsive Breakpoints
Use the following breakpoints for responsive design:

| Breakpoint Name | Width (px) | Usage |
|:----------------|:-----------|:------|
| mobile | < 768 | Mobile devices |
| tablet | 768 - 1023 | Tablet devices |
| desktop | 1024 - 1439 | Desktop screens |
| large | â‰¥ 1440 | Large screens |

Whenever using or wanting to use JavaScript, try to use AlpineJS as much as possible. This can be used for dropdowns, interactive elements, etc. 

Whenever I ask for a headline animation, please use the GSAP splitText & do a staggering fade up animation per word for the headline. Don't apply this to all headlines. Only when I ask for it.

For buttons, do a simple but aesthetic hover effect where the text fades up & the same text from the bottom fades in with easing.
